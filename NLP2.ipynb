Anyway, the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff... and Tom Savini! There is just no way this movie can fail! Right? wrong!! It just seems like such a waste! There was really no story, the dialog was terrible (is anyone there? x 1000!!!), the characters were.. well, they really lacked any kind of personality... The effects were terrible.. and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing.. with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff? We were sitting the whole movie waiting for something... anything to happen... but no... \\\"oh, here comes the nymphs! great! oh.. they're kissing... again... and now for the violence! OK... nothing really happens... again... oh, now they run around... and the closeups of eyes... again... oh, heres Tom Savini! Oh... he died... right... OK, maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen.. no.. oh! Cool! a severed head! the end... oh crap..\\\" And finally, since i'm so full of myself.. i'll tell you this! Give me a van, six actors, a weird looking house, Tom Savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie you've ever seen... I've made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects, better acting and a better script than this... what is this Johannes guy doing?? Making cool movies is easy!It could have been so great... I'm really upset!!\",\n          \"Gary Cooper is a cool headed guy. Always liked his easy going level headed characters. As some others have commented, there are some oddities in the script, such as a US Marshall who got his job and can't even hit a barn with a pistol. A rancher with about thirty hands but can't seem to keep his cattle from being run off.<br /><br />But there is plenty of the quick thinking, straight shooting Cooper to keep you entertained.<br /><br />This movie was made in 1950. People in their 20's and 30's have trouble understanding those movies were made for entertainment not Oscars. <br /><br />To expect Oscar material does this film injustice. It is about the good guys finding a way to round up the bad guys.<br /><br />So rent, borrow, or buy this movie, pop some corn and enjoy the Coop one more time.\",\n          \"Up until the last 20 minutes, I was thinking that this is possibly Jackie Chan's worst movie (excluding his pre-1978 work, which I am not familiar with). The final fight sequence changed all that: it is long and good and intense - indeed, one of the highlights of Chan's career. But to get to it, you have to sit through a lot of \\\"comedy\\\" that might amuse five-year-olds (oh, look! someone threw a tomato at that guy's face) and endless \\\"football\\\" scenes. Not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line \\\"How can I turn it off? It's not a tap\\\" - watch to find out what it refers to). \\\"Dragon Lord\\\" is worth renting for the final fight alone, but the rest of the movie is only for Jackie collectors, and even then only for those who've already seen at least 15 of his other movies.

train a word embedding model from our movie review corpus. Unfortunately, gensim's `Word2Vec` does not output reproducible results across different environments, so we will not grade this question. Instead, here we provide the implementation of the function `get_most_similar_words` that takes as input the `processed_reviews` column in our IMDB dataset, and for each input word, returns a list of `n_similar_words` top similar tokens to that word, based on the Word2Vec model. Here the tokens are ordered from lower to higher similarity values.\n","\n","You can see the code below and play around with different settings to better understand Word2Vec."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"B2AiR-A5l2M5"},"outputs":[],"source":["def find_most_similar_words(reviews, input_words, n_similar_words):\n","    corpus = [review.split() for review in reviews]\n","    model = Word2Vec(sentences = corpus, vector_size = 100, window = 5, workers = 4, min_count = 1)\n","    similar_words = []\n","    for inp_word in input_words:\n","        similar_words.append([w for w in sorted(model.wv.most_similar(inp_word, topn = n_similar_words), key = lambda x: x[1])])\n","    return similar_words"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Jqq9llpSl2M5","tags":["excluded_from_script"]},"outputs":[],"source":["def test_find_most_similar_words():\n","    input_words = [\"see\", \"good\", \"bad\", \"watch\", \"check\"]\n","    most_similar_words = find_most_similar_words(df_reviews[\"processed_review\"], input_words, 7)\n","    for i in range(len(input_words)):\n","        print(f\"Words most similar to '{input_words[i]}':\")\n","        print(most_similar_words[i])\n","        print()\n","\n","test_find_most_similar_words()"]}],"metadata":{"celltoolbar":"Tags","colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.16"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
